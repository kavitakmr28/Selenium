ls -l | head--> It will display top 10 file.

more command (Display the content of the file pagewise or page by page)
more filename.txt  --> it will display few data from the file and we need to press space from keyboard to check another data from next page.
Space bar key--> To check the data pagewise.
Enter key--> To check the data line by line.
q --> To go to the command promt.'

more and less command differen--> more command (We can't go to previous page but for less command we can navigate to both the direction),
less --> Press upper arrow key to go to the previous key and Spacebar to go to next page.

ls -l | less --> Display all the files pagewise and can go previous as well.

wc (Command) --> To count the numbers of lines,number of words , number of character in a file respectivily.
wc filename
eg: output- 5 10 64 file.
          numbers of lines,number of words , number of character in a file respectivily.
wc filename1 filename2
wc -l filename--> Only display the number of lines.
wc -w filename --> Only display number of words in the files.
wc -c filename --> Only display the number of character in the files.
wc -lw filename--> Display only number of lines and words of a file.

sort command --> Used to sort the data in file. 
sort filenae.txt> number_sorted.txt---> Move the sorted data to the new file.

Input , OutPut, Error redirection:  T
Input Redirection---> Instead of typing or taking the data or input from commond line, we are taking the input from the file,
Output Redirection---> Instead of displaying a data or output on the consol or terminal, it will get saved or write in file.
Error Redirection--> Instead of displaying the error on the consol or terminal, it will get saved or writre in file.

Symbol for all the Redirection:
